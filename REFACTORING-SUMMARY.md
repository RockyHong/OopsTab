# OopsTab Refactoring Summary

## Type Structure Refactoring

Based on the SoCGuide recommendations, we've restructured the types in the OopsTab project to improve organization and maintainability.

### Changes Made:

1. Created centralized type files in `/src/types/`:

   - `snapshot.ts` - For snapshot, tab, and tab group related types
   - `storage.ts` - For storage and configuration related types
   - `browser.ts` - For browser window and API related types
   - `message.ts` - For message types between UI and background script
   - `ui.ts` - For UI component and styling related types
   - `index.ts` - Re-exports all types for easier importing

2. Extracted types from implementation files:

   - Moved types from `snapshotManager.ts` to appropriate type files
   - Moved types from `windowTracking.ts` to `browser.ts`
   - Added documentation to all type definitions

3. Updated implementation files to use centralized types:

   - Updated imports in utility files to use the new type structure
   - Fixed component imports to import types from `/types/` instead of `/utils/`
   - Added backward compatibility by re-exporting types from `utils/index.ts`

4. Added documentation:
   - Created a comprehensive README.md in the types directory
   - Added JSDoc comments to all type files

### Benefits:

- **Better Organization**: Types are now grouped by domain rather than scattered across implementation files
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to types can be made in one place
- **Clear Separation**: Clear distinction between types and implementation
- **Consistent Usage**: Types are now used consistently across the application
- **Better Documentation**: Types are well-documented and easier to understand

### Backward Compatibility:

To ensure a smooth transition, we've maintained backward compatibility by:

1. Re-exporting types from the utils directory
2. Including clear comments in the code about the refactoring

### Next Steps:

1. Gradually update component imports to use the new type structure directly
2. Remove the re-exports from utils/index.ts when no longer needed
3. Continue to centralize any new types according to the guidelines

This refactoring follows the structure recommended in SoCGuide.md while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
