# OopsTab - Never Lose Your Tabs Again

**Restore Focus. Reclaim Context.** Your browsing sessions, always preserved.

A tiny browser extension that automatically snapshots windows and tabs—preserving entire workflow states. Captures those perfect setups: coding sessions with Stack Overflow army, research rabbit holes, your awesome business dashboards, that collection of manga chapters, or those eye candy tabs saved for design inspiration. All that structure stays intact for whenever it's needed again.

## Why OopsTab?

Browsers are powerful with their solid recovery features, but those rescue sessions often dissolve into scattered page history if we don't catch them in time. We've all been there—our carefully arranged tabs just vanish like they never existed.

It's that sneaky problem that trips us up when we least expect it, like that table leg we always stub our toe on. OopsTab is here to keeps those tabs from fading into oblivion. Not just saving pages, but preserving the entire vibe of what we were building, learning, or procrastinating on—ready to jump back in whenever the mood strikes.

## Purpose

OopsTab is a lightweight browser extension designed to preserve and restore the browsing context that matters.

Rather than simply tracking individual tabs, OopsTab captures the intent and mental structure behind each browser window — turning temporary browsing sessions into retrievable, meaningful workspaces. It acts as an ambient safety net, quietly remembering where you were so you can get back to it effortlessly.

## Core Experience

1. **Automatic Tracking** - Each browser window is assigned a unique internal ID. As the user browses, OopsTab monitors window changes and captures snapshots at meaningful moments — quietly, in the background.
2. **Session Timeline** - Snapshots are grouped by window and time, forming a browsable timeline of past activity. This includes both automatically captured sessions and sessions manually saved by the user.
3. **Effortless Restoration** - Users can restore any saved session into a new window. If the session is already open, OopsTab intelligently focuses that window instead of creating duplicates.
4. **Intentional Saving** - Users can "promote" an auto-saved session into a saved one — bookmarking it for future reference, protection, or long-term use.
5. **Clean, Friendly UI** - The interface is simple and inviting — a clean split between auto-captured sessions and user-saved ones, with buttons to restore, save, or delete each.
