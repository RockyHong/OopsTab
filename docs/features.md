# OopsTab Features & Capabilities

At its core, OopsTab is a **session-aware memory layer** for Chrome. It passively tracks the state of each browser window, takes intelligent snapshots over time, and allows users to retrieve, reopen, or save any past session — across restarts, crashes, or simple forgetfulness.

This is not just tab recovery. We're preserving the shape of thought behind how users structure their work, research, or routines — one window at a time.

## Design Philosophy

- **Zero-friction recovery**: The product should feel ambient and reliable. Snapshots happen behind the scenes, and users only need to engage when they want to.
- **Cognitive alignment**: A browser window reflects a task, idea, or workflow. OopsTab's structure mirrors this — tracking at the window level, not just tabs.
- **No clutter**: The interface avoids noise. It shows what matters now, with the ability to dig into history if needed.
- **Tool-first, human-aware**: It's a utility, but with empathy. OopsTab protects users from disruption and preserves the subtle mental threads they were following.

## How It Works

- Every new window gets a persistent internal ID.
- Snapshots are triggered by meaningful events (e.g., tab changes, window closes).
- Snapshots are stored and grouped under that window ID, forming a session history.
- Users can view, save, delete, or reopen sessions at any time.
- If a saved session is already open, OopsTab focuses it instead of reopening.

## Key Features

### Automatic Tracking {#automatic-tracking}

Each browser window is assigned a unique internal ID. As the user browses, OopsTab monitors window changes and captures snapshots at meaningful moments — quietly, in the background.

### Session Timeline {#session-timeline}

Snapshots are grouped by window and time, forming a browsable timeline of past activity. This includes both automatically captured sessions and sessions manually saved by the user.

### Effortless Restoration {#effortless-restoration}

Users can restore any saved session into a new window. If the session is already open, OopsTab intelligently focuses that window instead of creating duplicates.

### Intentional Saving {#intentional-saving}

Users can "promote" an auto-saved session into a saved one — bookmarking it for future reference, protection, or long-term use.

### Clean, Friendly UI {#clean-ui}

The interface is simple and inviting — a clean split between auto-captured sessions and user-saved ones, with buttons to restore, save, or delete each.
