🧭 OopsTab – Product Overview

Restore Focus. Reclaim Context.

⸻

🎯 Purpose

OopsTab is a lightweight browser extension designed to preserve and restore the browsing context that matters.

Rather than simply tracking individual tabs, OopsTab captures the intent and mental structure behind each browser window — turning temporary browsing sessions into retrievable, meaningful workspaces. It acts as an ambient safety net, quietly remembering where you were so you can get back to it effortlessly.

✨ What We’re Building

At its core, OopsTab is a session-aware memory layer for Chrome. It passively tracks the state of each browser window, takes intelligent snapshots over time, and allows users to retrieve, reopen, or save any past session — across restarts, crashes, or simple forgetfulness.

This is not just tab recovery. We’re preserving the shape of thought behind how users structure their work, research, or routines — one window at a time.

🧱 Core Experience 1. Automatic Tracking
Each browser window is assigned a unique internal ID. As the user browses, OopsTab monitors window changes and captures snapshots at meaningful moments — quietly, in the background. 2. Session Timeline (Optional)
Snapshots are grouped by window and time, forming a browsable timeline of past activity. This includes both automatically captured sessions and sessions manually saved by the user. 3. Effortless Restoration
Users can restore any saved session into a new window. If the session is already open, OopsTab intelligently focuses that window instead of creating duplicates. 4. Intentional Saving
Users can “promote” an auto-saved session into a saved one — bookmarking it for future reference, protection, or long-term use. 5. Clean, Friendly UI
The interface is simple and inviting — a clean split between auto-captured sessions and user-saved ones, with buttons to restore, save, or delete each.

💡 Design Philosophy
• Zero-friction recovery: The product should feel ambient and reliable. Snapshots happen behind the scenes, and users only need to engage when they want to.
• Cognitive alignment: A browser window reflects a task, idea, or workflow. OopsTab’s structure mirrors this — tracking at the window level, not just tabs.
• No clutter: The interface avoids noise. It shows what matters now, with the ability to dig into history if needed.
• Tool-first, human-aware: It’s a utility, but with empathy. OopsTab protects users from disruption and preserves the subtle mental threads they were following.

🛠 How It Works (High-Level)
• Every new window gets a persistent internal ID.
• Snapshots are triggered by meaningful events (e.g., tab changes, window closes).
• Snapshots are stored and grouped under that window ID, forming a session history.
• Users can view, save, delete, or reopen sessions at any time.
• If a saved session is already open, OopsTab focuses it instead of reopening.
